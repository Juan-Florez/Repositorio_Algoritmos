## Goal
The goal of this work is to compare and face brute force algorithms with greedy algorithms for the problem of find the roots of a polynom
## Complexity
Taking n as the size of the interval for find the answer the complexity of the brute force algorithm is O(n), for other size taking as a reference the time complexity of binary search trees we can get intuetively a complexity of O(log(n)) for the bisection algorithm, given that in some degree we are doing a binary search.
## Note
by mistake this readme was not upload at time in this repository but can be seen that the same one is upload since before the time limit in pawell steven torres gutierrez repository
